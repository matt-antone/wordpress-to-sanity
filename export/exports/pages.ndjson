PEOPLE spoke with California-based family law attorney and former psychologist, David Glass of EPGR Lawyers, who said that “money and an embarrassing spotlight on the couple’s squabbling” were likely significant factors. “People go to court and then if one party does not do well, which Mrs. Costner didn’t do well, she got a third of the (child) support she wanted. She didn’t get her award for fees. She was told that the prenuptial agreement was going to be upheld. Then she starts considering, do I really want to litigate the rest of this?” Glass observed.","_key":"c8c357fa179c6"}],"markDefs":[{"_key":"be758c6bc8c0","_type":"link","href":"https://people.com/tag/kevin-costner/"},{"_key":"d9bfe92f835e","_type":"link","href":"https://people.com/movies/who-is-christine-baumgartner-kevin-costner-wife/"},{"_key":"6677e884314b","_type":"link","href":"https://people.com/kevin-costner-ex-christine-settle-divorce-4-months-after-filing-report-7971554"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"0e0c229473ab","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"PEOPLE confirmed Tuesday that the 68-year-old ","_key":"0e0c229473ab0"},{"_type":"span","marks":["fb3275166f8e"],"text":"Oscar","_key":"0e0c229473ab1"},{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":" winner and his estranged wife, 49, had reached a settlement agreement four and a half months after she filed for dissolution of marriage, listing their date of separation as April 11.","_key":"0e0c229473ab2"}],"markDefs":[{"_key":"fb3275166f8e","_type":"link","href":"https://people.com/tag/academy-awards/"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"bcfdfeed9cca","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"To read the full article, click ","_key":"bcfdfeed9cca0"},{"_type":"span","marks":["107c001ec29f"],"text":"here","_key":"bcfdfeed9cca1"},{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":".","_key":"bcfdfeed9cca2"}],"markDefs":[{"_key":"107c001ec29f","_type":"link","href":"https://people.com/kevin-costner-ex-christine-divorce-settlement-expert-explains-exclusive-7971871"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal"}],"image":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@http://epgrlawyers.local/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Magazine_Consults.jpg"}}

When asked if he thought Depp returning to the stand last week was beneficial to his case, Glass said, “I don’t think it benefitted either of them… His testimony really didn’t add or detract from his case, or from Amber Heard’s case.” Glass went on to explain what the jury needs to consider when deliberating a defamation suit. “The juries are given very specific instructions. They have a checklist they have to go through. First of all, there has to be a bad statement made of someone that was false. It has to have been made with actual malice, and then the hardest part is showing that the person with who the statement was made was damaged financially.
