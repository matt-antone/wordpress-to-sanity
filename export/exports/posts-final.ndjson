Glass’ arguments in the matter centered on the “Gavron” warning that compelled his client to become employed at a reasonable level to help support herself and the children, and the fact that she had completed an extensive job search in Santa Barbara but had been unable to find full-time work. In terms of the school issue, Glass argued that California’s “Establishment Clause” – prohibiting the state from choosing one religion over another or of choosing a religious option over a non-religious option – prevented the Court from choosing to have the children remain in their current school. In the simplest of terms, Glass argued that if the parties could not agree to enroll the children in a religious school, that the only option became which parent had a better public school option.","_key":"82fa448516850"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"c2b89a44cb19","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"The Court recognized Glass’ client’s primary custodial care history, her valid and reasonable job offer, and her choice of a high-quality public school in Hidden Hills, and allowed the mother to relocate with the children.

Stephens said he was an early adviser to Siminoff and invested more than $100,000 into the company in exchange for stock, after Siminoff failed to secure an investor on Sharl Tank in 2013. In April 2018, Amazon purchased the tech company for more than $1 billion. That’s when Siminoff refused to honor Stephens’ contributions, according to the complaint. Ring’s general counsel Leila Rouhi refused to honor his stock option rights, “contending that Russell had forfeited all such rights by not exercising them within 30 days of offering to resign from Ring’s Board of Directors on October 31, 2016.” Among other charges, Russell sued Siminoff and Ring for fraud and requested rescission of the patents he “signed away” after leaving the board. In this case, Stephens was represented by Darren Enenstein of EPGR Lawyers.","_key":"d5231ddc7bce0"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"4ae7d5f8882f","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":["dfdea8ca0126"],"text":"‘Shark Tank’ Business Owner Sued in $300M Fraud Case | Courthouse News Service","_key":"4ae7d5f8882f0"}],"markDefs":[{"_key":"dfdea8ca0126","_type":"link","href":"https://www.courthousenews.com/shark-tank-business-owner-sued-for-fraud/"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal"}],"image":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@http://epgrlawyers.local/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sharktank.jpg"}}

The fate of both Depp and Heard’s complaints rests on the decision of 7 jurors. GMA featured EPGR’s David Glass for his expert opinion on which of the parties would likely come out ahead. When asked if he thought Depp returning to the stand last week was beneficial to his case, Glass said, “I don’t think it benefitted either of them… His testimony really didn’t add or detract from his case, or from Amber Heard’s case.” Glass went on to explain what the jury needs to consider when deliberating a defamation suit. “The juries are given very specific instructions. They have a checklist they have to go through. First of all, there has to be a bad statement made of someone that was false. It has to have been made with actual malice, and then the hardest part is showing that the person with who the statement was made was damaged financially. Connecting that one little statement to having their career ruined, that’s the hardest part of a defamation case.” He added that “both of these parties went far afield of what the defamation case is all about.” In terms of jury options, Glass said the jury had three options, “first to find for Johnny Depp, that he was defamed and hurt, or they could find for Amber, that she was defamed or hurt, but most likely what the jury is going to do is send both parties home with nothing, and saying ‘a pox on both your houses.”","_key":"2bdc62f6b17b0"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"49719fa2aeb2","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Watch the full interview at ","_key":"49719fa2aeb20"},{"_type":"span","marks":["178b19117795"],"text":"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/video/jury-deliberations-begin-depp-heard-defamation-trial-85038562","_key":"49719fa2aeb21"}],"markDefs":[{"_key":"178b19117795","_type":"link","href":"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/video/jury-deliberations-begin-depp-heard-defamation-trial-85038562"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal"}],"image":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@http://epgrlawyers.local/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-31-at-12.00.43-PM.png"}}

Most of us were predicting that this would be a wash; that neither of the parties would walk away with anything, because of the difficulty to prove defamation.” He added that it would be “possible” that there were Depp fans on the jury “but not probable” due to the thoroughness of Heard’s attorneys. Glass, who holds a doctorate in clinical psychologist and is a family law specialist, provided insight into both the potential personal goals for each party for filing, as well as the impact of this holding on their professional lives.
